**Hours)**

**Rules** **&** **Regulations**

• The duration of the test is 4 hours.

• You may use AI tools (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot etc.) for
assistance, but ensure you understand and can explain your
implementation.

• Follow Laravel best practices and the coding standards outlined here:

• Use migrations, factories, and seeders for database setup.

• All APIs must return consistent REST responses with proper HTTP status
codes.

• Write test cases to validate core features and edge cases.

• Submit your solution as a compressed folder or via a file-sharing
link.

**Task** **Brief**

Build an **Event** **Booking** **System** (backend).

The system should include: - Authentication

\- Event & Ticket Management

\- Bookings & Payments (mocked) - Role-based Access Control

\- Middleware

\- Reusable Components (Traits & Services) - Notifications & Caching

This test evaluates skills in: - Database Design

\- Eloquent Models & Relationships - REST API Development

\- Authentication & Authorization - Middleware, Services, Traits

\- Queues & Notifications - Caching & Optimization

***Section*** ***1:*** ***Database*** ***&*** ***Models***

Time: 45 minutes

Weightage: 20%

• Models: User, Event, Ticket, Booking, Payment.

• **User**: id, name, email, password, phone, role (enum: admin,
organizer, customer).

**Event**: id, title, description, date, location, created_by.

• Relationships: belongsTo(User), hasMany(Ticket).

• **Ticket**: id, type (VIP, Standard, etc.), price, quantity, event_id.
• Relationships: belongsTo(Event), hasMany(Booking).

• **Booking**: id, user_id, ticket_id, quantity, status (pending,
confirmed, cancelled). • Relationships: belongsTo(User),
belongsTo(Ticket), hasOne(Payment).

• **Payment**: id, booking_id, amount, status (success, failed,
refunded). • Relationships: belongsTo(Booking).

• Create migrations, implement relationships, factories, and seeders.

***Section*** ***2:*** ***Authentication*** ***&*** ***Authorization***

Time: 30 minutes

• Implement Registration, Login, Logout using Sanctum. • Protect routes
with middleware.

• Role-based access control: Admin → Manage all events, tickets,
bookings. Organizer → Manage their own events/tickets. Customer → Book
tickets & view bookings.

***Section*** ***3:*** ***API*** ***Development***

Time: 60 minutes

Weightage: 25%

• **User** **APIs**:

• POST /api/register • POST /api/login

• POST /api/logout • GET /api/me

• GET /api/events (pagination, search, filter by date/location) • GET
/api/events/{id} (with tickets)

• POST /api/events (organizer only)

• PUT /api/events/{id} (organizer only)

• DELETE /api/events/{id} (organizer only) • **Ticket** **APIs**:

• POST /api/events/{event_id}/tickets (organizer only) • PUT
/api/tickets/{id} (organizer only)

• DELETE /api/tickets/{id} (organizer only) • **Booking** **APIs**:

• POST /api/tickets/{id}/bookings (customer) • GET /api/bookings
(customer’s bookings) • PUT /api/bookings/{id}/cancel (customer)

• **Payment** **APIs**:

• POST /api/bookings/{id}/payment (mock payment) • GET
/api/payments/{id}

***Section*** ***4:*** ***Middleware,*** ***Services*** ***&***
***Traits***

Time: 20 minutes

Weightage: 10%

• Custom Middleware: Prevent double booking for the same ticket. •
Service Class: PaymentService (simulate success/failure).

• Trait: CommonQueryScopes with filterByDate() and searchByTitle().

***Caching***

Time: 20 minutes

Weightage: 10%
